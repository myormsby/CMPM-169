			<h1>Experiment 2 - Vector Art, Animation & Interactivity</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Imitate</h2>
				<p>At first I was inspired by the piece (ph4se.space), mainly because it resembled a stream of fish swimming through a river and tracking the currents. Something about that really resonated with me and I wanted to make something peaceful that you could relax and watch, like the rain on a river. </p>
				<p>This second piece (Jay 2021) had many colored circles showing up, and since I knew I wanted to do something relating to water, I decided to do something similar to this. Although it wouldnt be quite as colorful, I wanted to make something akin to ripples on a pond.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Integrate</h2>
				<p>So originally during section I was playing around with p5.js and ended up coding a version that would randomly distribute circles of the same size on a blue background that resembled water. This was close, but I decided I wanted the circles to move outward and fade slowly just like real ripples.</p>
				<p>To do this, I added the highlighted code inside a for loop I got from chat.gpt that would slowly have the circles move out and fade. After a certain amount of time, I would delete the circles after they faded to save memory.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Innovate</h2>
				<p>I also decided that although this was satisfactory in being peaceful, I wanted to add some user interactivity. So once again with the help and assistance from chat.gpt I was able to include a function called mousePressed that would spawn another circle that was slightly larger than the other circles. This circle would mimic the others and would also fade slowly and expand.</p>
				<p>Finally I wanted to add a sound effect of rain in the background, to completely sell the effect. If I had more time I would have made a song and had each note play once you clicked.</p>
				<p>But after many many failed attempts, I figured it did not work :( I will continue to try and implement this in the future.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>To be honest I’m very disappointed that I was not able to get the sound libraries working for p5.js. I wanted to create a musical adventure and was not able to. Although I also wanted to add videos of fish and lilypads, I didn’t think I had enough time. I made the entire project with the help of chat.gpt.</p>
				</ul>
